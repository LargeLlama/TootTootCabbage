## Hypothesis:
Empirical runtime would be approximately linear with some possible discrepancies
 
## Background:
We are trying to determine whether a matrix finder algorithm is O(n) time or not
 
## Test Methodology: 
 
Matrix Size = 50 -> 10000, increment 50: 50, 100, 150, 200,..., 9950, 10000 
 
Trials for each Size = 100 
 
Started time before search function 
Recorded time at search function end 
 
Output to CSV file 
 
## Results
 

## Conclusions
